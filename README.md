OpenCart Extensions
=============================

These are a collection of my open source OpenCart extensions.  OpenCart is a PHP based eCommerce system with excellent extension support.

INSTALLATION
------------
The OpenCart extensions here require [[vQmod]](http://code.google.com/p/vqmod/).  It is super easy to install, so don't let an additional requirement put up a road block for you!

Each extension folder has it's own README associated with it.  The README will let you know how to install a particular extension.

EXTENSION ORGANIZATION
------------
You will see the extensions organized like:

      extensions/          base directory
      |-- name1/           name of extension
        `-- upload/      directory to be uploaded to OpenCart server
