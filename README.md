OpenCart Extensions
=============================

These are a collection of my open source OpenCart extensions.  OpenCart is a PHP based eCommerce system with excellent extension support.

INSTALLATION
------------
The OpenCart extensions here require [[vQmod]](http://code.google.com/p/vqmod/).  It is super easy to install, so don't let an additional requirement put up a road block for you!

Each extension folder has it's own README associated with it.  The README will let you know how to install a particular extension.

EXTENSION ORGANIZATION
------------
Extension versions will be in the following format:

    X.yy.zzz
    
    X   = Major version  (major features adds)
    yy  = Minor versions (bug fixes)
    zzz = compatible opencart version

You will see the extensions organized like:

      extensions/          base directory
      |-- name1/           name of extension
        |-- X.yy.zz/       versioning
          `-- upload/      directory to be uploaded to OpenCart server
